This is what we will likely be using for this project:

Visual Studio 2010
DirextX SDK (latest version: June 2010)
Havok Physics SDK
Havok Content Tools (if you're going to be doing stuff with Maya)
Maya 2012
Pivotal Tracker
GitHub
Git Extensions


Set up DirectX SDK with Visual Studio 2010: http://takinginitiative.net/2010/07/02/setting-up-the-directx-sdk-with-visual-studio-2010/



Other info:

Git Extensions: gitextensions.googlecode.com/files/GitExtensions228SetupComplete.msi
	(probably want to install MsysGit and KDiff as well, included with the installer, just make sure you check the appropriate boxes in the installer)
	-DO NOT USE PUTTY (github doesn't support it), use OpenSSH instead
	-If you're installing Git through this installer, also make sure you set the line-ending conversion settings in the installer to "Checkout as-is, commit as-is" so we don't get any problems with line endings

Pivotal Tracker: www.pivotaltracker.com
	-Once you sign up, give me your usernames and I'll add you to the project.
	The project's URL is https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/448573 but it's set to be Private right now

	
	
When using Git, please try to create a branch of your own and just working on that branch on your local PC,
then commit and push only to that branch on GitHub, then after testing everything, merge the branch with the master branch on GitHub
