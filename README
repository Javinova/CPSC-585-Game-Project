This is what we will likely be using for this project:

Visual Studio 2010
DirectX SDK (latest version: June 2010) [We'll be developing for DirectX 9.0c]
Havok Physics SDK
Havok Content Tools (if you're going to be doing stuff with Maya)
Maya 2012
Pivotal Tracker
GitHub
Git Extensions/Git GUI

Other info:

Git Extensions: gitextensions.googlecode.com/files/GitExtensions228SetupComplete.msi
	(probably want to install MsysGit and KDiff as well, included with the installer, just make sure you check the appropriate boxes in the installer)
	-DO NOT USE PUTTY (github doesn't support it), use OpenSSH instead
	-If you're installing Git through this installer, also make sure you set the line-ending conversion settings in the installer to "Checkout as-is, commit as-is" so we don't get any problems with line endings

Pivotal Tracker: www.pivotaltracker.com
	-Once you sign up, give me your usernames and I'll add you to the project.
	The project's URL is https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/448573

	
Good way to work on the repository:

1) Clone repository to your PC (ONE TIME. Havok is ~150MB and won't change)
2) Copy the cpsc585 Visual Studio directory to a new place (if you're doing this
on your university account, keep the cloned repository on a USB stick, otherwise
you'll take up too much space on your account with 2 copies of Havok)
3) Edit the copied cpsc585 (so NOT in the cloned repository directory) as you like
4) Under the Build menu in VS2010, go Clean Solution
5) In Git GUI, open the cloned repository, and Create a Branch (this also checks out the branch)
6) copy your modified cpsc585 folder over the one in the cloned repository
7) In the Git GUI, go Rescan, then Stage Changed, then Commit
8) Branch -> Checkout -> Master
9) Merge -> Local -> yourBranchName
10) Push to origin!
11) If the repo has been updated, just PULL instead of Clone, so you don't re-download Havok,
then do your edits as mentioned above
